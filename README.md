# dfsocial-bridge

DFSocial holders who bought our old tokens before the close of the bridge (October 31 2021 at 11:48:18 PM +UTC) will be able to use our bridge on our website (https://dfsocial.com/exchange.html) to swap $bDFSocial to $DFSG once their wallet addresses have been whitelisted on our smart contract.

Join our Discord server https://dfsocial.link/discord and create a bridging ticket in #support channel and our team will help you out.
You can find below a quick tutorial to know how to use our bridge once your wallet is allowed to use it.
